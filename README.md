<h1 align = "center">TMDB-Poster-Downloader</h1>
<p align = "center">A simple program written in python that recieves a TMDB API key and a movie id and downloads all of the images available on the website.</p>

## Use cases
1. Backdrops can be used in reviews and analyses relevant to the movie they're about (e.g. I used one that I found on TMDB for <a href="https://medium.com/@erfan1382gh/a-complete-breakdown-of-annette-2021-from-start-to-finish-8b7c28e39d94">my analyses on Annette (2021)</a>).
2. Logos can be indispensable for video essayists especially because a lot of the ones provided by TMDB have transparent backgrounds which makes them great for thumbnails.
3. Posters can be a great encapsulation of the marketing techniques used in the industry at the time, they can also give you great contrast when compared to posters from other countries which are sometimes also provided on the website.

Posters and backdrops can be a very neat thing for all movie enthusiasts.
